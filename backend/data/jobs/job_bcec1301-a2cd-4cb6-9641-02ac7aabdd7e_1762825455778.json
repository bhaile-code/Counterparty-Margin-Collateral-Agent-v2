Initial parse required ambiguity resolution through Sonnet model (3 resolution passes with confidence scores 0.885, 0.885, and 0.9). Haircut of 25.93% and valuation at 74.07% are complementary and validated. Taxonomy and logic validation passed. Confidence reduced from perfect score due to: (1) multiple ambiguity detection passes (20 iterations at step 2), (2) need for 3 separate ambiguity resolution cycles, and (3) lack of confidence scores in initial parsing phase. Final output represents consensus from resolution iterations with highest confidence at 0.9."
