Resolution step achieved 0.885 confidence, indicating strong agreement on the straightforward nature of cash collateral. Both taxonomy and logic validation passed without corrections. The processing pipeline required no self-corrections, and the final output aligns with standard market practices for cash collateral treatment. Minor confidence reduction from perfect score (0.05) accounts for the inherent uncertainty in any automated parsing system, though this represents a best-case scenario with minimal complexity."
