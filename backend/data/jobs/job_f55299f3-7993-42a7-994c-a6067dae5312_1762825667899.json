Initial parse required ambiguity resolution through 2 Sonnet model iterations (confidence: 0.885, 0.9). Taxonomy and logic validation passed. Haircut of 25.93% and valuation of 74.07% are consistent and sum to 100%. Confidence reduced from maximum due to: (1) multiple initial parse attempts (20 iterations), (2) ambiguity detection requiring 19 passes, (3) need for 2 resolution cycles, and (4) lack of confidence scores in early pipeline stages. Final output validated against standard taxonomy for sovereign debt instruments."
