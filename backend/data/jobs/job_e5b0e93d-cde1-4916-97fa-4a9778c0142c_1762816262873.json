Multiple models (haiku for initial parsing, sonnet for ambiguity resolution with confidence scores ranging 0.52-0.96) were unable to identify or normalize any collateral information. This indicates either: (1) source data contained no recognizable collateral information, (2) data format was incompatible with all parsing strategies, or (3) critical parsing failure occurred at the initial extraction phase. Without any successfully parsed fields, maturity buckets, or identifiable collateral type, the output cannot be validated or used for downstream processing.
