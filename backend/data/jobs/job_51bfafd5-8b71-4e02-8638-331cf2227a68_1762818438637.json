The reasoning chain shows repeated attempts across all processing stages but no successful data extraction. This suggests either: (1) the input document was empty/corrupted, (2) the document format was not recognized by any parser, or (3) the document contained no structured collateral data.

The reasoning chain shows 276 processing steps across initial_parse, detect_ambiguities, resolve_ambiguities, validate_taxonomy, validate_logic, and synthesize phases, but the parsed data output contains only UNKNOWN type with empty maturity buckets. This indicates either: (1) the source document contained no recognizable collateral information, (2) all parsing attempts failed to extract structured data, or (3) validation rules rejected all extracted data. The extensive number of processing attempts (multiple iterations through all pipeline stages) without producing valid output suggests fundamental issues with either the input data quality or compatibility with the parsing taxonomy.
