Despite multiple processing attempts (25 initial parses, 25 ambiguity detections, 50 ambiguity resolutions, and 44 synthesis steps), no valid collateral information could be extracted. The reasoning chain shows repeated attempts at all processing stages but no successful data extraction. This suggests either: (1) no input data was provided, (2) the input format was unrecognizable, or (3) a systematic failure in the parsing pipeline. Recommend reviewing the source data format and ensuring it contains valid collateral information before reprocessing."
