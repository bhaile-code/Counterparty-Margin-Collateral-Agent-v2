This indicates either: (1) no collateral information was present in the input, (2) the data format was incompatible with the parsing models, or (3) the source data was corrupted or empty. The high number of processing steps with null confidence values in early stages suggests the models could not find recognizable patterns. No validation could be performed due to absence of data. Manual review of the source input is required."
