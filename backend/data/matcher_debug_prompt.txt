For each CSV row, match it to the best-fitting CSA collateral description and maturity bucket.
Consider BOTH the collateral description AND the maturity range when matching.

For each CSV row, return a JSON object with:
- csv_row: The row number
- matched_csa_description: The exact CSA collateral description (or null if no match)
- matched_standardized_type: The standardized type (or null)
- matched_maturity_bucket_min: Minimum years of matched bucket (or null)
- matched_maturity_bucket_max: Maximum years of matched bucket (or null)
- confidence: Match confidence from 0.0 to 1.0
- reasoning: Brief explanation of why this match was chosen (1-2 sentences)

If a CSV item spans multiple maturity buckets or doesn't fit any bucket precisely, choose the
most conservative (highest haircut) bucket and note this in the reasoning.

If no good match exists (confidence < 0.5), set matched_csa_description to null and explain
why in the reasoning.

Return ONLY a JSON array with one object per CSV row, in order:
[
  {"csv_row": 1, "matched_csa_description": "...", ...},
  {"csv_row": 2, "matched_csa_description": "...", ...},
  ...
]
